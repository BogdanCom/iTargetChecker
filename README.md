## About itargetchecker

Checks the xcode proj file for targets and points out which files from the project are not present in a certain target.
Usualy this helps if you have a project with multiple targets and you want to make sure that certain classes/resources from your project are present in each of the targets.

At the first run you should check the plugin without passing some ignore files just to see what the plugin finds. After the first run, you should check for false alarms and add those files to youre custom ignore list.

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. 

If you are new to Fastlane or haven't installed a plugin for Fastlane before, please check the plugins section below. 
Shortcut for those who don't have time to read more:
- Execute the following commands:
```bash
fastlane add_plugin fastlane-plugin-itargetchecker
fastlane install_plugins
 ```
    
 After these you should be able to use the plugin as pointed in the example below.


## Example

Check out the [example `Fastfile`](fastlane/Fastfile) to see how to use this plugin. Try it by cloning the repo, running `fastlane install_plugins` and `bundle exec fastlane test`.
You can now use regex in the ignored files strings passed to the plugin. That can help you to ignore certain file types like .h or Tests.m.

**Note:** The ignored files added in the sample should be changed to match your own rules. 

**Quick ussage sample:**

```ruby 
itargetchecker(project_path:"../YourProj.xcodeproj", 
                    ignore_files:["SwiftyJSON.framework", "CoreLocation.framework", "Pods-YourProjRelease.release.xcconfig", 
                    "Pods-YourProjRelease.debug.xcconfig", "Pods-YourProj.release.xcconfig", "Pods-YourProj.debug.xcconfig", "Info.plist", "Base", "BRASL.h"],
                    ignore_targets:["YourProjTests"])
```

## Run tests for this plugin (to be continued..)
